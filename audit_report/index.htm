    CDASH is a treasure chest that accumulates knowledge collected and organized over a long period of time.  Once items are initially loaded into the Production CDASH Instance, information about places and documents may be corrected or enriched, and before too long, CDASH becomes the only repository for the most authoritative representation of the Architectural Survey.  
  </p><p>
    The CHC Omeka Owner and the Administrator understand that the information in the CHC Omeka installation would be nearly impossible to regenerate should some sort of disaster strike or more importantly, if some simple mistake results in information disappearing or becoming corrupt. 
    <p>The prospect of noticing that some number of CDASH items has disappeared or been damaged, without knowing the extent of the damage or when and why the information was lost should make us very anxious. 
    <B>The Good News</b> is that our web host, Microsoft Azure, contains facilities for recovering the necessary components to rebuild the Production CDASH instance and its contents. Nevertheless, recovery from backups has the following limitations:
    <ul>
      <li>The backup snapshots must exist and be functional. 
      <li>Recovery must be completed before the backups are purged (normally 30 days) 
      <li>Recovery is a process of rewinding all changes back to a spacific point in time, therefoe all intervening changes will be lost. 
      <li>Recovering an Omake instance requires specialized knowledge and azure login permissions that the CHC Omeka administrator probably does not have.
      </ul>
      
    <p>THe key to a happy life is to have a regular routine of verifying that everything is OK and or for catching any problems without delay.

<h3 id="audits">The Importance of Regular Audits</h3>
<p> Most computer users have experienced the sinking feeling that accompanies the discovery of mysterious lost or corrupted data.  Even if you have a great backup system, one of the trickiest problems is figuring out the extent of the problem and when the problem occurred.  The less time that has elapsed between the problem and the discovery of it, the greater will be the hope that a complete restoration can be made without problems. 

<h3 id="problems">What could Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>Here is a list of the sorts of things that can go wrong. 
<ul>
  <li>Place or Document Items disappear.
  <li>Media (scannned pages) associated with Document Items may disappear.
  <li>Item properties can become messed up due to errors with bulk editing.
  <li>Relationships between Places, Documents or Folders could become discombobulated, leading to orphan documents and places or folders that seem to have no related information.
  <li>Other</b>
</ul>
<h3>Beware the Unexpected!</h3>
<p>As an example, did you know that if you remove a property from the resource template for a a type if item (Place or Document) that all of the values for that property will disappear without any warning or easy recovery method? This is the sort of a trap that may not be detected for a very long time after it has sprung.  



<h2 id="culture">Establish a Culture of Data Safety and Accountability</h2>
<p>It is  most regrettable when an orgamnization loses irreplaceable information without even noticing that the loss has occurred. 
<p>When it comes to protecting assets, a sense of anxiety is healthy -- especially if it motivates the department director, the Omeka Manager and the Azure System Administrator to establish regular routines of validating and reporting on the integrity of various sytem components.   We recommend that the following checks be carried out every week by the Omeka Administrator and reported to the CHC Omeka Owner.


<h2 id="manager">CHC Omeka Manager Weekly Journal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check the user interface of CDASH, click all of the map layers on and off. Notice load times for viewing and accessing the edit view of pages.
  <li>In the Azure Portal:
    <ul>
      <li>Check the CHCOmeka performance Monitor graphs for the past 7 days of Response Time and Requests
      <li>Verify that the backup daily snapshots and retention schedules are occuring as expected for each of the file shares in the storage accounts CHCpersit and CHCScans and the CHCMySQL database.
      </ul>
   <li>In Omeka, look at the count of Folders, Place Items, Document Items and Media files.  Compare with previous week. 
   </ul>

  <h2 id="admin">Azure Administrator Monthly Journal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Azure portal, verify that backup snapshots are recoverable
    <li>Check the performance stats for the CHCOmeka web app for abnormal activity. 
    <li>With SQL Workbench, take a monthly persistent snapshot of the Omeka schema and store it in the CHCOffline/dbbackups folder. 
    </ul>
