  <h1 class="title">Theme Layout</h1>
  <p>The CDASH theme is a custom Omeka theme that integrates a map and tabbed navigation framework that provides pathways for investigating locations and related documents through the map or through the search of place names or a faceted search and filtering of documents</p>

  <h3>Topic Index</h3>  <!-- notice these paths reference the root folder so that this list can be copied to the index sidebar-->

    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">The Omeka Themes</h2>
<p>The primary way that Omeka sites are adjusted to suit specific institutions and collections is through themes.  The Omeka project provides several <a href="https://omeka.org/s/themes/" target="outboard">off-the-shelf themes</a> that are ready to install and configure.  Most institutions choose one of these as a point of departure for a customization with styling and layout and localized content. The Omeka-S developer documentation provides <a href="https://omeka.org/s/docs/developer/themes/" target="outboard">guidance on how to customize themes. </a>
</p>
<p>The CDASH custom theme includes several major differences from the standard-issue themes. 
  <ul>
    <li>The map window, 
    <li>a custom place search functionality 
    <li>A tabbed navifation model that emulates the Place, Folder and Document structure of the Building Files Collection. 
  </ul>

    <h2 id="wireframe">The Wireframe Layout</h2>
  <p>The CDASH Theme is a bare-bones application of CSS Grid layout, which is barebones at this point but should provide the necessary bobes for making the various components re-organized themselves for small screens. The wireframe demonstration provides the basic framework for a one-page application that makes efficient re-use of downloaded search results and intuitive forward-and-back tracking from search to places to documents and back to folders, places and search results with a minimal amount of re-downloading stuff from the server.
