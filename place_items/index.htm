  <h1 class="title">CDASH Place Items</h1>
  <p>This page discusses the notion of CDASH Place Items as catalog records describing various types of places within the digital collection management environment provided by Omeka-S.

    <p>
      For more information on the concept of an Omeka Item and the role of  CDASH place Items, see <a href="../schema/index.htm" >CDASH Schema</a>.

      <h2>Required Derived Place Properties</h2>
      <p>Several place properties are derived by assembling values of other place properties.  This work is accomplished by the GeoSync function.  If you are creating place items by hand, you should keep in mind that these derived properties must be initialized  (even with dummy values) or the GeoSync function will not be able to assign new values to them.
      <tr><th width="20%">Name</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
      
      <tr><td><b>Place Item</b><br>Text <b>*</b></td>
        <td>Automatically Concatenated from the House Number and the Place Name (if it exists).  The value of this propwerty serves as the title for the Place Item, and is also the name that appears as name of the parent place for each associated Document Item.   </td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td><b>Street Sort Key</b><br>Text</td>
        <td>Automatically calculated from House Number and Streetname, concatenated with the right number of leading zeroes.</td>

        <tr><td><b>Street Address</b><br>Text</td>
        <td>Addresses are automatically concatenated from the House Number and Street Name.</td>
      </tr>

    </table>

<p><b>*</b> Note that the value for the CDASH: PlaceItem property, when it is associated with a Place Item, is a plain text string, that serves as the title for the Place Item.  The reason this property is re-used in this way is to simplify the search of items related to a place whether they should be places or documents. 

<h2>Optional Place Properties</h2>
<p>These properties are not populated by the batch accession tool, but they have vbeen carefully sdesigned in xcollaboration with the survey manager to be used to add useful information to place items as needed.

    <h2>Legacy Place Properties</h2>
    <p>The batch accession process creates a couple of properties that turn out not to be updated or used by Omeka.  It happens that they can be used to trace the lineage of place items in the event of accidents.
    <table class="dictionary">
      <tr><th width="20%">Name</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>

      <tr><td><b>CDASH Place Identifier</b><br>text</td>
        <td>The place Identifier property is used during the bulk import process.  Values consist of "CDP_" concatenated by the original value for House Number, Street Name, and potentially, the original Place Name that were assigned during the accession process.   Although the Place Identifier is not used and not updated, it can be useful for tracing the lineage of an item   </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><b>CDASH Folder</b><br>Text</td>
        <td>
          These folder references were used during the bulk import process to generate Omeka item sets. After the initia accession of items the link between an item with its "CDASH Folders" (really, Omeka Item-Sets) is managed through the Item Sets tab on the item edit page.  
          Although the values for an item's CDASH Folder property are not updated, they may be useful for tracing the lineage of an item in case something happens to the omeka item-set or its links.  
      </td></tr>
          </table>

<h2>Deprecated Place Properties</h2>
<p>These properties were part of the origianl schema design.  They were never populated and are slated for removal from the schema. 
    <table class="dictionary">
      <tr><th width="20%">Name</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><b>MACRIS Inventory Number</b><br>Text, URL</td>
        <td>When a document or a place is connected with a specific referent of the Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System,  Use the URI button to set the <b>Label</b> field to be the MACRIS ID, and the <b>URI</b> field to the landing page for the related MACRIS Resource. <a href="https://maps.mhc-macris.net/" target=""macris">Search MACRIS here.</a>
          <br>After saving, check that the result performs as a clickable link.
          <br>This field is not recommended since the MACRIS map layer is easier for users and much easier to manage. 
        </td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Assessing Map Lot</b><br>URL</td>
        <td>This field deprecated since the Assessing map layer is easier for users and much easier to manage. 
       </td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>Street Address</b><br>Text</td>
        <td>This property has been replaced by the individual properties: House Number and Street Name. 
       </td></tr>
    </table>

  
<h2>Controlled Vocabularies for Places</h2>
<p>The following lists are used as pick-lists to normalize the assignment of key-words to CDASH Place Items.  These lists are implemented and managed with the <a href="https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/customvocab/" target="omeka">Omeka-S Custom Vocab module. </a> 

<h3 id="types">Place Types</h3>
<p>Each CDASH Place is assigned to one place type.  At the bulk cataloging stage these are all plain street addresses.  Later in the data enrichment phase. Historical Commission staff may create new place items or correct or enhance existing items to better reflect the subject matter of the related documents.  For this effort, it is necessary to try to cover at least 95% of the possible place -types with controlled vocabulary pick-lists.

<ul>
  <li><b>Address: </b>
  <li><b>Building: </b>
  <li><b>Streets and Squares: </b>These places refer to stretches of streets and squares.  Their spots are located in rights-of-way.  When a neighborhood or survey district boundary is nearby, try to put the spot in the most appropriate district. 
  <li><b>Bridge: </b>
  <li><b>Object: </b> This category will include but is not limited to:
    <ul>
    <li>monuments
      <li>benches
      <li>flagpoles
      <li>fences
      <li>signs
      <li>public art
      <li>water fountains
    </ul>
  <li><b>Open Space: </b> broad category with future option to parse into subgroups (see below). Examples: Charles River Reservation, Fresh Pond, Fresh Pond Golf Course, and the Harvard Science Center Plaza. This category will include but is not limited to some of the items below. As we handle the survey files, it will be useful for us all to observe and think about items that may fall into this category and keep in mind possible subcategories, which will include:
    <ul>
      <li>bodies of water (term still TBD)
      <li>cemeteries
      <li>parks
    </ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="tbd">Terms TBD for Enrichment Phase</h2>
<p>After the semi-automated creation of CDASH Place Items, staff will be able create new place items or to enrich the automatically created ones.  In this enrichment phase, it will save time and promote consistency to have frequently used terminology available in drop-down lists.  
<p>These lists should be prepared and approved by a subject-matter expert.    

  <p>Users will be offered the opportunity to choose terms from one of the following.     
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/" target="sidecar">Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus</a>
  <li><a href="https://authorities.loc.gov/" target="sidecar">Library of Congress Subject Authority Headings</a>
  </ul>
<p>Editors will have the ability to choose from these authorities or they can enter free-text.

<p>It is not necessary to have these lists ready right away.
