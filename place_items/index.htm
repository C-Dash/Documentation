  <h1 class="title">CDASH Place Items</h1>
  <p>This page discusses the notion of CDASH Place Items as catalog records describing various types of places within the digital collection management environment provided by Omeka-S.

    <p>
      For more information on the concept of an Omeka Item and the role of  CDASH place Items, see <a href="../schema/index.htm" >CDASH Schema</a>.

      <h2>Required Derived Place Properties</h2>
      <p>Several place properties are derived by assembling values of other place properties.  This work is accomplished by the GeoSync function.  If you are creating place items by hand, you should keep in mind that these derived properties must be initialized  (even with dummy values) or the GeoSync function will not be able to assign new values to them.

<h2>Controlled Vocabularies for Places</h2>
<p>The following lists are used as pick-lists to normalize the assignment of key-words to CDASH Place Items.  These lists are implemented and managed with the <a href="https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/customvocab/" target="omeka">Omeka-S Custom Vocab module. </a> 

<h3 id="types">Place Types</h3>
<p>Each CDASH Place is assigned to one place type.  At the bulk cataloging stage these are all plain street addresses.  Later in the data enrichment phase. Historical Commission staff may create new place items or correct or enhance existing items to better reflect the subject matter of the related documents.  For this effort, it is necessary to try to cover at least 95% of the possible place -types with controlled vocabulary pick-lists.

<ul>
  <li><b>Address: </b>
  <li><b>Building: </b>
  <li><b>Streets and Squares: </b>These places refer to stretches of streets and squares.  Their spots are located in rights-of-way.  When a neighborhood or survey district boundary is nearby, try to put the spot in the most appropriate district. 
  <li><b>Bridge: </b>
  <li><b>Object: </b> This category will include but is not limited to:
    <ul>
    <li>monuments
      <li>benches
      <li>flagpoles
      <li>fences
      <li>signs
      <li>public art
      <li>water fountains
    </ul>
  <li><b>Open Space: </b> broad category with future option to parse into subgroups (see below). Examples: Charles River Reservation, Fresh Pond, Fresh Pond Golf Course, and the Harvard Science Center Plaza. This category will include but is not limited to some of the items below. As we handle the survey files, it will be useful for us all to observe and think about items that may fall into this category and keep in mind possible subcategories, which will include:
    <ul>
      <li>bodies of water (term still TBD)
      <li>cemeteries
      <li>parks
    </ul>

<h2 id="tbd">Terms TBD for Enrichment Phase</h2>
<p>After the semi-automated creation of CDASH Place Items, staff will be able create new place items or to enrich the automatically created ones.  In this enrichment phase, it will save time and promote consistency to have frequently used terminology available in drop-down lists.  
<p>These lists should be prepared and approved by a subject-matter expert.    

  <p>Users will be offered the opportunity to choose terms from one of the following.     
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/" target="sidecar">Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus</a>
  <li><a href="https://authorities.loc.gov/" target="sidecar">Library of Congress Subject Authority Headings</a>
  </ul>
<p>Editors will have the ability to choose from these authorities or they can enter free-text.

<p>It is not necessary to have these lists ready right away.
