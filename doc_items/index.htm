      <h2>Required Derived Document Properties</h2>
      <p>Several document properties are derived by assembling values from the property of the document's parent place.  This work is accomplished by the GeoSync function.  If you are creating document items by hand, you should keep in mind that these derived properties must be initialized  (even with dummy values) or the GeoSync function will not be able to assign new values to them.

    <h2>Controlled Vocabularies for Documents</h2>
    <p>The following lists are used as pick-lists to normalize the assignment of key-words to CDASH Document Items.  These lists are implemented and managed with the <a href="https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/customvocab/" target="omeka">Omeka-S Custom Vocab module. </a> 

    <h3 id="defaults">CDASH Document Types and Default Metadata Properties</h3>
    <p>The CDASH Document collection is initialized through a semi-automated rough sort process that resulted in the assignment of scanned images to one of thirteen pre-defined item types.  These are document types that were chosen to comprise a nearly-complete categorization of the types of documents contained in the Building Files collection. 
      <p>Classification of document types is accomplished quickly by looking at one-inch thumbnails of  scanned pages, selecting pages that belong together, then dragging their icons into a bin according to the type of document represented. 
      <p>
        Assignment of document types determines the assignment of several default item properties like titles, subjects that set up various search and filter and navigation possibilities.
      <p>The table below exposes the configuration of document types and corresponding default properties that are set in the CDASH Rough Sort toolkit [link forthcoming].

    <h3 id="autotitle">Automatic Title Assignment for Document Items</h3>
    <p>DUring the bulk-upload process, the title for each document is constructed by concatenating the Place Name associated with the document, a hyphen, and the Document Type.  For example:
      <ul>
        <li><b>77 Massachusetts Avenue - Photo Contact Sheet</b>
      </ul>

  <h2 id="subjects">CDASH Recommended Subjects</h2>
  <p>Assigning subject keywords to document items causes them to be more amenable to search, filtering and discovery.  
    <p>
    To save time and to promote consistency, CDASH metadata editors are offered a list of CDASH Subjects that they can pick from.  The list is easily editable by a user with administrative permission. 
<p>
    Users will always be able to choose from other lists or just type free-text. 
<p>These terms are drawn from popular authoritative conventions wherever possible.
